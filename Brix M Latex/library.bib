abstract = {The Handbook Argumentation Theory provides an up to date survey of the various theoretical contributions to the development of argumentation theory for all scholars interested in argumentation, informal logic and rhetoric. It describes the historical roots of modern argumentation theory that are still an important theoretical background to contemporary approaches. Because of the complexity, diversity and rate of developments in argumentation theory, there is a real need for an overview of the state of the art, the main approaches that can be distinguished and the distinctive features of these approaches. The Handbook covers classical and modern backgrounds to the study of argumentation, the New Rhetoric developed by Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca, the Toulmin model, formal approaches, informal logic, communication and rhetoric, pragmatic approaches, linguistic approaches and pragma-dialectics. The Handbook is co-authored by Frans H. van Eemeren, Bart Garssen, Erik C.W. Krabbe, A. Francisca Snoeck Henkemans, Bart Verheij and Jean Wagemans, who are a coherent and prominent writing team whose expertise covers the whole field.

Fortunately, with the interactive and open features of microblogs, skeptical and opposing voices against fake news always arise along with it. The conflicting information, ignored by existing studies, is crucial for news verification. In this paper, we take advantage of this &quot;wisdom of crowds&quot; information to improve news verification by mining conflicting viewpoints in microblogs. First, we discover conflicting viewpoints in news tweets with a topic model method. Based on identified tweets’ viewpoints, we then build a credibility propagation network of tweets linked with supporting or opposing relations. Finally, with iterative deduction, the credibility propagation on the network generates the final evaluation result for news. Experiments conducted on a real-world data set show that the news verification performance of our approach significantly outperforms those of the baseline approaches. &lt;/p&gt; }, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Jin, Zhiwei and Cao, Juan and Zhang, Yongdong and Luo, Jiebo}, year={2016}, month={Mar.} }

abstract = {Research in recommender systems is now starting to recognise the importance of multiple
selection criteria to improve the recommendation output. In this paper, we present
a novel approach to multi-criteria recommendation, based on the idea of clustering
users in "preference lattices" (partial orders) according to their criteria preferences.
We assume that some selection criteria for an item (product or a service) will dominate
the overall ranking, and that these dominant criteria will be different for different
users. Following this assumption, we cluster users based on their criteria preferences,
creating a "preference lattice". The recommendation output for a user is then based
on ratings by other users from the same or close clusters. Having introduced the general
approach of clustering, we proceed to formulate three alternative recommendation methods
instantiating the approach: (a) using the aggregation function of the criteria, (b)
using the overall item ratings, and (c) combining clustering with collaborative filtering.
We then evaluate the accuracy of the three methods using a set of experiments on a
service ranking dataset, and compare them with a conventional collaborative filtering
approach extended to cover multiple criteria. The results indicate that our third
method, which combines clustering and extended collaborative filtering, produces the
highest accuracy.},

Various aspects can contribute to the development of trust toward such an agent, including perceptions about the usefulness of the recommendations, the transparency of the recommendation process, and the general quality of the website. These factors have been analyzed in isolation in the literature though. We propose and evaluate a new trust model that integrates these factors, and allows us to assess their relative importance for trust-building. We conducted empirical studies in the context of two popular e-commerce websites. The findings suggest that transparency is equally important to consumers for building trust as recommendation quality, and that general we site quality contributes to the development of trust. The findings indicate that focusing on recommendation quality may be insufficient and higher levels of adoption of the recommendations can be achieved when several trust-building factors are considered.},

  abstract={In recent years, recommender systems have become an important part of various applications, supporting both customers and providers in their decision-making processes. However, these systems still must overcome limitations that reduce their performance, like recommendations' overspecialization, cold start, and difficulties when items with unequal probability distribution appear or recommendations for sets of items are asked. A novel approach, addressing the above issues through a case-based recommendation methodology, is presented here. The scope of the presented approach is to generate meaningful recommendations based on items' co-occurring patterns and to provide more insight into customers' buying habits. In contrast to current recommendation techniques that recommend items based on users' ratings or history, and to most case-based item recommenders that evaluate items' similarities, the implemented recommender uses a hierarchical model for the items and searches for similar sets of items, in order to recommend those that are most likely to satisfy a user.},

In this paper, we have proposed a novel content-based recommender system based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Jensen-Shannon distance, which can be used specifically for the task of literature recommendations. We have compared this model with the standard cosine-similarity based approach for its use to generate scientific publication recommendations, in which recommend suitable journals/conferences to publish a research work based on the abstract of the user's manuscript as an input. We evaluated the results of both the proposed model and standard cosine-similarity based approach over unseen documents and achieved a precision score of 62.58{\%} while the standard cosine-similarity based approach achieved a precision of only around 48{\%}.},

abstract = {This paper presents a proposal for system supporting learners in improving their report-writing skills by recommending reports from previous learners. The proposed system recommends reports that share similar subjects but which have different structures, expressions, and originality based on the distributions of words and subjects within the reports, as estimated using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). An important assumption made for this study is that reports with different word distributions tend to include different structures, expressions, and originality when they share similar subjects. Based on that assumption, the system selects and recommends reports that have dissimilar word distributions but which share similar subject distributions with a learner's report. The proposed system is expected to enhance learning of various writing skills from other learners. Finally, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system through actual data experiments.},

abstract = {Recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence and data analytics are facilitating the automation of some consumer chores (e.g., in smart homes and in self-driving cars) and allow the emergence of big-data-driven, micro-targeting marketing practices (e.g., personalized content recommendation algorithms). We contend that those developments can generate a tension for marketers, consumers, and policy makers: They can, on the one hand, contribute to consumer well-being by making consumer choices easier, more practical, and more efficient. On the other hand, they can also undermine consumers' sense of autonomy, the absence of which can be detrimental to consumer well-being. Drawing on diverse perspectives from marketing, economics, philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology, we explore how consumers' sense of autonomy in making choices affects their well-being. We discuss how new technologies may enhance or diminish consumers' perceptions of being in control of their choices and how either of those can, in turn, enhance of detract from consumer well-being. Building on this, we identify open research questions in the domain of choice, well-being, and consumer welfare, and suggest avenues for future research.},

These issues undermine the ability to replicate our research – a critical element of scientific investigation and analysis. In IS empirical and analytics research articles, the amount of space devoted to the details of data collection, validation, and/or quality pales in comparison to the space devoted to the evaluation and selection of relatively sophisticated model form(s) and estimation technique(s). Yet erudite modeling and estimation can yield no immediate value or be meaningfully replicated without high quality data inputs. The purpose of this paper is: 1) to detail potential quality issues with data types currently used in IS research, and 2) to start a wider and deeper discussion of data quality in IS research. No data type is inherently of low quality and no data type guarantees high quality. As researchers, our empirical research must always address data quality issues and provide the information necessary to determine What, When, Where, How, Who, and Which.}

LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

@inproceedings{dong2017hybrid,
abstract = {Collaborative filtering(CF) is a widely used approach in recommender systems to solve many real-world problems. Traditional CF-based methods employ the user-item matrix which encodes the individual preferences of users for items for learning to make recommendation. In real applications, the rating matrix is usually very sparse, causing CF-based methods to degrade significantly in recommendation performance. In this case, some improved CF methods utilize the increasing amount of side information to address the data sparsity problem as well as the cold start problem. However, the learned latent factors may not be effective due to the sparse nature of the user-item matrix and the side information. To address this problem, we utilize advances of learning effective representations in deep learning, and propose a hybrid model which jointly performs deep users and items' latent factors learning from side information and collaborative filtering from the rating matrix. Extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our hybrid model outperforms other methods in effectively utilizing side information and achieves performance improvement.},

Social recommendation methods collect ratings of artifacts from many individuals, and use nearest-neighbor techniques to make recommendations to a user concerning new artifacts. However, these methods do not use the significant amount of other information that is often available about the nature of each artifact - such as cast lists or movie reviews, for example. This paper presents an inductive learning approach to recommendation that is able to use both ratings information and other forms of information about each artifact in predicting user preferences. We show that our method outperforms an existing social-filtering method in the domain of movie recommendations on a dataset of more than 45,000 movie ratings collected from a community of over 250 users.},

abstract = "Recommender systems are filters which suggest items or information that might be interesting to users. These systems analyze the past behavior of a user, build her profile that stores information about her interests, and exploit that profile to find potentially interesting items. The main limitation of this approach is that it may provide accurate but likely obvious suggestions, since recommended items are similar to those the user already knows. In this paper we investigate this issue, known as overspecialization or serendipity problem, by proposing a strategy that fosters the suggestion of surprisingly interesting items the user might not have otherwise discovered. The proposed strategy enriches a graph-based recommendation algorithm with background knowledge that allows the system to deeply understand the items it deals with. The hypothesis is that the infused knowledge could help to discover hidden correlations among items that go beyond simple feature similarity and therefore promote non-obvious suggestions. Two evaluations are performed to validate this hypothesis: an in vitro experiment on a subset of the hetrec2011-movielens-2k dataset, and a preliminary user study. Those evaluations show that the proposed strategy actually promotes non-obvious suggestions, by narrowing the accuracy loss."

@article{Koltcov2021,
abstract = {Hierarchical topic modeling is a potentially powerful instrument for determining topical structures of text collections that additionally allows constructing a hierarchy representing the levels of topic abstractness. However, parameter optimization in hierarchical models, which includes finding an appropriate number of topics at each level of hierarchy, remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an approach based on Renyi entropy as a partial solution to the above problem. First, we introduce a Renyi entropy-based metric of quality for hierarchical models. Second, we propose a practical approach to obtaining the “correct” number of topics in hierarchical topic models and show how model hyperparameters should be tuned for that purpose. We test this approach on the datasets with the known number of topics, as determined by the human mark-up, three of these datasets being in the English language and one in Russian. In the numerical experiments, we consider three different hierarchical models: hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation model (hLDA), hierarchical Pachinko allocation model (hPAM), and hierarchical additive regularization of topic models (hARTM). We demonstrate that the hLDA model possesses a significant level of instability and, moreover, the derived numbers of topics are far from the true numbers for the labeled datasets. For the hPAM model, the Renyi entropy approach allows determining only one level of the data structure. For hARTM model, the proposed approach allows us to estimate the number of topics for two levels of hierarchy.},

Our collective knowledge is continued to be accumulated in the form of electronic texts, blogs, news, images, audios, videos and in many more ways and on account of this there is a greater need of analyzing these huge contents to get rid of the difficulties in searching the object, we aim for. Topic modelling is an efficient machine learning techniques for discovering the hidden semantic structure of contents. “Latent Dirichlet Allocation” (LDA) is a generative probabilistic topic modelling, which is the basis of other generative topic modelling techniques. New models are coming up with advanced algorithms in order to improve the topic modelling. Existing models have their own limitation. In case of obtaining more accuracy, the processing time of topic modelling goes high while in consideration of achieving more speed, accuracy gets low. Most of the algorithms implemented earlier cannot perform well in above-mentioned area. In this paper, we would like to introduce parallel-supervised LDA model where supervised Latent Dirichlet Algorithm (sLDA) and parallel Latent Dirichlet Algorithm (pLDA) are applied together to obtain high accurate results with quicker response time.},

The evaluation of the algorithm performance uses the topic coherence. As unstructured data, the Twitter data need preprocessing before the analysis. The stages of preprocessing include cleansing, stemming, and stop words. The advantages of LSA are fast and easy to implement. LSA, on the other hand, doesn't consider the relationship between documents in the corpus, while LDA does. This study shows that LDA gives a better result than LSA.},

Popular techniques involve content-based (CB) models and collaborative filtering (CF) approaches. In this paper, we deal with a very important problem in RSs: The cold start problem. This problem is related to recommendations for novel users or new items. In case of new users, the system does not have information about their preferences in order to make recommendations. We propose a model where widely known classification algorithms in combination with similarity techniques and prediction mechanisms provide the necessary means for retrieving recommendations. The proposed approach incorporates classification methods in a pure CF system while the use of demographic data help for the identification of other users with similar behavior. Our experiments show the performance of the proposed system through a large number of experiments. We adopt the widely known dataset provided by the GroupLens research group. We reveal the advantages of the proposed solution by providing satisfactory numerical results in different experimental scenarios."

abstract = {The goal of machine learning is to program computers to use example data or past experience to solve a given problem. Many successful applications of machine learning exist already, including systems that analyze past sales data to predict customer behavior, optimize robot behavior so that a task can be completed using minimum resources, and extract knowledge from bioinformatics data. Introduction to Machine Learning is a comprehensive textbook on the subject, covering a broad array of topics not usually included in introductory machine learning texts. In order to present a unified treatment of machine learning problems and solutions, it discusses many methods from different fields, including statistics, pattern recognition, neural networks, artificial intelligence, signal processing, control, and data mining. All learning algorithms are explained so that the student can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer program. The text covers such topics as supervised learning, Bayesian decision theory, parametric methods, multivariate methods, multilayer perceptrons, local models, hidden Markov models, assessing and comparing classification algorithms, and reinforcement learning. New to the second edition are chapters on kernel machines, graphical models, and Bayesian estimation; expanded coverage of statistical tests in a chapter on design and analysis of machine learning experiments; case studies available on the Web (with downloadable results for instructors); and many additional exercises. All chapters have been revised and updated. Introduction to Machine Learning can be used by advanced undergraduates and graduate students who have completed courses in computer programming, probability, calculus, and linear algebra. It will also be of interest to engineers in the field who are concerned with the application of machine learning methods. Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series}

@inproceedings{AlSumait2009,
abstract = {Topic models, like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), have been recently used to automatically generate text corpora topics, and to subdivide the corpus words among those topics. However, not all the estimated topics are of equal importance or correspond to genuine themes of the domain. Some of the topics can be a collection of irrelevant words, or represent insignificant themes. Current approaches to topic modeling perform manual examination to find meaningful topics. This paper presents the first automated unsupervised analysis of LDA models to identify junk topics from legitimate ones, and to rank the topic significance. Basically, the distance between a topic distribution and three definitions of ``junk distribution'' is computed using a variety of measures, from which an expressive figure of the topic significance is implemented using 4-phase Weighted Combination approach. Our experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in ranking the topic significance.},

@article{Bates9977,
abstract = {This paper surveys some of the fundamental problems in natural language (NL) understanding (syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse) and the current approaches to solving them. Some recent developments in NL processing include increased emphasis on corpus-based rather than example- or intuition-based work, attempts to measure the coverage and effectiveness of NL systems, dealing with discourse and dialogue phenomena, and attempts to use both analytic and stochastic knowledge. Critical areas for the future include grammars that are appropriate to processing large amounts of real language; automatic (or at least semi-automatic) methods for deriving models of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; self-adapting systems; and integration with speech processing. Of particular importance are techniques that can be tuned to such requirements as full versus partial understanding and spoken language versus text. Portability (the ease with which one can configure an NL system for a particular application) is one of the largest barriers to application of this technology.},

The methodological approach integrated data-driven codes with theory-driven ones based on the tenets of social phenomenology. The authors present a detailed exemplar of the staged process of data coding and identification of themes. This process demonstrates how analysis of the raw data from interview transcripts and organizational documents progressed toward the identification of overarching themes that captured the phenomenon of performance feedback as described by participants in the study. }
