are often presented with a variety of options within their programmes of study and
making appropriate and informed decisions can be a challenge. Compared to many other

In this part of our research we use non-negative matrix factorisation to identify
dependencies between modules, visualise sequential recommendations, and bring structure

It has been studied intensively because of its wide applicability in various areas such as web mining, search engines, and information retrieval. It is measuring similarity between documents and grouping similar documents together. It provides efficient representation and visualization of the documents; thus helps in easy navigation also. In this paper, we have given overview of various document clustering methods studied and researched since last few years, starting from basic traditional methods to fuzzy based, genetic, co- clustering, heuristic oriented etc. Also, the document clustering procedure with feature selection process, applications, challenges in document clustering, similarity measures and evaluation of document clustering algorithm is explained.},

abstract = {Research in recommender systems is now starting to recognise the importance of multiple
selection criteria to improve the recommendation output. In this paper, we present
a novel approach to multi-criteria recommendation, based on the idea of clustering
users in "preference lattices" (partial orders) according to their criteria preferences.
We assume that some selection criteria for an item (product or a service) will dominate
the overall ranking, and that these dominant criteria will be different for different
users. Following this assumption, we cluster users based on their criteria preferences,
creating a "preference lattice". The recommendation output for a user is then based
on ratings by other users from the same or close clusters. Having introduced the general
approach of clustering, we proceed to formulate three alternative recommendation methods
instantiating the approach: (a) using the aggregation function of the criteria, (b)
using the overall item ratings, and (c) combining clustering with collaborative filtering.
We then evaluate the accuracy of the three methods using a set of experiments on a
service ranking dataset, and compare them with a conventional collaborative filtering
approach extended to cover multiple criteria. The results indicate that our third
method, which combines clustering and extended collaborative filtering, produces the
highest accuracy.},

  abstract={In recent years, recommender systems have become an important part of various applications, supporting both customers and providers in their decision-making processes. However, these systems still must overcome limitations that reduce their performance, like recommendations' overspecialization, cold start, and difficulties when items with unequal probability distribution appear or recommendations for sets of items are asked. A novel approach, addressing the above issues through a case-based recommendation methodology, is presented here. The scope of the presented approach is to generate meaningful recommendations based on items' co-occurring patterns and to provide more insight into customers' buying habits. In contrast to current recommendation techniques that recommend items based on users' ratings or history, and to most case-based item recommenders that evaluate items' similarities, the implemented recommender uses a hierarchical model for the items and searches for similar sets of items, in order to recommend those that are most likely to satisfy a user.},

@article{Hanani2001,
abstract = {An abundant amount of information is created and delivered over electronic media. Users risk becoming overwhelmed by the flow of information, and they lack adequate tools to help them manage the situation. Information filtering (IF) is one of the methods that is rapidly evolving to manage large information flows. The aim of IF is to expose users to only information that is relevant to them. Many IF systems have been developed in recent years for various application domains. Some examples of filtering applications are: filters for search results on the internet that are employed in the Internet software, personal e-mail filters based on personal profiles, listservers or newsgroups filters for groups or individuals, browser filters that block non-valuable information, filters designed to give children access them only to suitable pages, filters for e-commerce applications that address products and promotions to potential customers only, and many more. The different systems use various methods, concepts, and techniques from diverse research areas like: Information Retrieval, Artificial Intelligence, or Behavioral Science. Various systems cover different scope, have divergent functionality, and various platforms. There are many systems of widely varying philosophies, but all share the goal of automatically directing the most valuable information to users in accordance with their User Model, and of helping them use their limited reading time most optimally. This paper clarifies the difference between IF systems and related systems, such as information retrieval (IR) systems, or Extraction systems. The paper defines a framework to classify IF systems according to several parameters, and illustrates the approach with commercial and academic systems. The paper describes the underlying concepts of IF systems and the techniques that are used to implement them. It discusses methods and measurements that are used for evaluation of IF systems and limitations of the current systems. In the conclusion we present research issues in the Information Filtering research arena, such as user modeling, evaluation standardization and integration with digital libraries and Web repositories.},

abstract = {This paper presents a proposal for system supporting learners in improving their report-writing skills by recommending reports from previous learners. The proposed system recommends reports that share similar subjects but which have different structures, expressions, and originality based on the distributions of words and subjects within the reports, as estimated using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). An important assumption made for this study is that reports with different word distributions tend to include different structures, expressions, and originality when they share similar subjects. Based on that assumption, the system selects and recommends reports that have dissimilar word distributions but which share similar subject distributions with a learner's report. The proposed system is expected to enhance learning of various writing skills from other learners. Finally, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system through actual data experiments.},

abstract = {Recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence and data analytics are facilitating the automation of some consumer chores (e.g., in smart homes and in self-driving cars) and allow the emergence of big-data-driven, micro-targeting marketing practices (e.g., personalized content recommendation algorithms). We contend that those developments can generate a tension for marketers, consumers, and policy makers: They can, on the one hand, contribute to consumer well-being by making consumer choices easier, more practical, and more efficient. On the other hand, they can also undermine consumers' sense of autonomy, the absence of which can be detrimental to consumer well-being. Drawing on diverse perspectives from marketing, economics, philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology, we explore how consumers' sense of autonomy in making choices affects their well-being. We discuss how new technologies may enhance or diminish consumers' perceptions of being in control of their choices and how either of those can, in turn, enhance of detract from consumer well-being. Building on this, we identify open research questions in the domain of choice, well-being, and consumer welfare, and suggest avenues for future research.},

abstract = {We argue that there are major, persistent numerical data quality issues in IS academic research. These issues undermine the ability to replicate our research – a critical element of scientific investigation and analysis. In IS empirical and analytics research articles, the amount of space devoted to the details of data collection, validation, and/or quality pales in comparison to the space devoted to the evaluation and selection of relatively sophisticated model form(s) and estimation technique(s). Yet erudite modeling and estimation can yield no immediate value or be meaningfully replicated without high quality data inputs. The purpose of this paper is: 1) to detail potential quality issues with data types currently used in IS research, and 2) to start a wider and deeper discussion of data quality in IS research. No data type is inherently of low quality and no data type guarantees high quality. As researchers, our empirical research must always address data quality issues and provide the information necessary to determine What, When, Where, How, Who, and Which.}

abstract = "Recommender systems are filters which suggest items or information that might be interesting to users. These systems analyze the past behavior of a user, build her profile that stores information about her interests, and exploit that profile to find potentially interesting items. The main limitation of this approach is that it may provide accurate but likely obvious suggestions, since recommended items are similar to those the user already knows. In this paper we investigate this issue, known as overspecialization or serendipity problem, by proposing a strategy that fosters the suggestion of surprisingly interesting items the user might not have otherwise discovered. The proposed strategy enriches a graph-based recommendation algorithm with background knowledge that allows the system to deeply understand the items it deals with. The hypothesis is that the infused knowledge could help to discover hidden correlations among items that go beyond simple feature similarity and therefore promote non-obvious suggestions. Two evaluations are performed to validate this hypothesis: an in vitro experiment on a subset of the hetrec2011-movielens-2k dataset, and a preliminary user study. Those evaluations show that the proposed strategy actually promotes non-obvious suggestions, by narrowing the accuracy loss."

@article{Koltcov2021,
abstract = {Hierarchical topic modeling is a potentially powerful instrument for determining topical structures of text collections that additionally allows constructing a hierarchy representing the levels of topic abstractness. However, parameter optimization in hierarchical models, which includes finding an appropriate number of topics at each level of hierarchy, remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an approach based on Renyi entropy as a partial solution to the above problem. First, we introduce a Renyi entropy-based metric of quality for hierarchical models. Second, we propose a practical approach to obtaining the “correct” number of topics in hierarchical topic models and show how model hyperparameters should be tuned for that purpose. We test this approach on the datasets with the known number of topics, as determined by the human mark-up, three of these datasets being in the English language and one in Russian. In the numerical experiments, we consider three different hierarchical models: hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation model (hLDA), hierarchical Pachinko allocation model (hPAM), and hierarchical additive regularization of topic models (hARTM). We demonstrate that the hLDA model possesses a significant level of instability and, moreover, the derived numbers of topics are far from the true numbers for the labeled datasets. For the hPAM model, the Renyi entropy approach allows determining only one level of the data structure. For hARTM model, the proposed approach allows us to estimate the number of topics for two levels of hierarchy.},

Our collective knowledge is continued to be accumulated in the form of electronic texts, blogs, news, images, audios, videos and in many more ways and on account of this there is a greater need of analyzing these huge contents to get rid of the difficulties in searching the object, we aim for. Topic modelling is an efficient machine learning techniques for discovering the hidden semantic structure of contents. “Latent Dirichlet Allocation” (LDA) is a generative probabilistic topic modelling, which is the basis of other generative topic modelling techniques. New models are coming up with advanced algorithms in order to improve the topic modelling. Existing models have their own limitation. In case of obtaining more accuracy, the processing time of topic modelling goes high while in consideration of achieving more speed, accuracy gets low. Most of the algorithms implemented earlier cannot perform well in above-mentioned area. In this paper, we would like to introduce parallel-supervised LDA model where supervised Latent Dirichlet Algorithm (sLDA) and parallel Latent Dirichlet Algorithm (pLDA) are applied together to obtain high accurate results with quicker response time.},

Because of that, Surabaya Government made Media Center Surabaya. This media is used to accommodate all the aspiration of Surabaya citizen. To access this media, a citizen can use Twitter. The topic which is discussed in Twitter is important information that we need to know. The information can be used to improve the performance of Surabaya Government services. Twitter data is a text data that consists of thousands of variables. Text mining is frequently used to analyze this kind of data, including topic modeling and sentiment analysis. This study would work on topic modeling focused on the algorithm employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). The evaluation of the algorithm performance uses the topic coherence. As unstructured data, the Twitter data need preprocessing before the analysis. The stages of preprocessing include cleansing, stemming, and stop words. The advantages of LSA are fast and easy to implement. LSA, on the other hand, doesn't consider the relationship between documents in the corpus, while LDA does. This study shows that LDA gives a better result than LSA.},

Popular techniques involve content-based (CB) models and collaborative filtering (CF) approaches. In this paper, we deal with a very important problem in RSs: The cold start problem. This problem is related to recommendations for novel users or new items. In case of new users, the system does not have information about their preferences in order to make recommendations. We propose a model where widely known classification algorithms in combination with similarity techniques and prediction mechanisms provide the necessary means for retrieving recommendations. The proposed approach incorporates classification methods in a pure CF system while the use of demographic data help for the identification of other users with similar behavior. Our experiments show the performance of the proposed system through a large number of experiments. We adopt the widely known dataset provided by the GroupLens research group. We reveal the advantages of the proposed solution by providing satisfactory numerical results in different experimental scenarios."

abstract = {Fa{\c{c}}ade is a real-time, first-person dramatic world in which the player, visiting the married couple Grace and Trip at their apartment, quickly becomes entangled in the high-conflict dissolution of their marriage. The Fa{\c{c}}ade interactive drama integrates real-time, autonomous believable agents, drama management for coordinating plot-level interactivity, and broad, shallow support for natural language understanding and discourse management. In previous papers, we have described the motivation for Fa{\c{c}}ade's interaction design and architecture [13, 14], described ABL, our believable agent language [9, 12], and presented overviews of the entire architecture [10, 11]. In this paper we focus on Fa{\c{c}}ade's natural language processing (NLP) system, specifically the understanding (NLU) portion that extracts discourse acts from player-typed surface text.},

@article{Bates9977,
abstract = {This paper surveys some of the fundamental problems in natural language (NL) understanding (syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse) and the current approaches to solving them. Some recent developments in NL processing include increased emphasis on corpus-based rather than example- or intuition-based work, attempts to measure the coverage and effectiveness of NL systems, dealing with discourse and dialogue phenomena, and attempts to use both analytic and stochastic knowledge. Critical areas for the future include grammars that are appropriate to processing large amounts of real language; automatic (or at least semi-automatic) methods for deriving models of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; self-adapting systems; and integration with speech processing. Of particular importance are techniques that can be tuned to such requirements as full versus partial understanding and spoken language versus text. Portability (the ease with which one can configure an NL system for a particular application) is one of the largest barriers to application of this technology.},

The methodological approach integrated data-driven codes with theory-driven ones based on the tenets of social phenomenology. The authors present a detailed exemplar of the staged process of data coding and identification of themes. This process demonstrates how analysis of the raw data from interview transcripts and organizational documents progressed toward the identification of overarching themes that captured the phenomenon of performance feedback as described by participants in the study. }
