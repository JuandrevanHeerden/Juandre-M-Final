%% I suggest that you always include these packages

\usepackage{apacite}    % enable apa citations to be formatted correctly
\usepackage{url}        % handle urls that need to break accross lines
\usepackage{booktabs}   % a bit nicer tables than the standard -- not part of standard distribution
\usepackage{amsthm }    % for having nice definition and theorem environments
\usepackage{verbatim}

%\graphicspath{{./eps/}} % keep those large eps files in separate sub-directory
                        % one down from current directory  -- if you want to that is

\bigspace               % enables the one-and-half spacing (about) for the document
                        % if you need to use single spacing in eg a table
                        % switch to \smallspace and immediately afterwards

                                   % which would be numbered as "Caveat 1", "Solution 1", etc.
