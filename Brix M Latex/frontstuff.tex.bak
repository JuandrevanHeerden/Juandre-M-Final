\chapter{Abstract}

Information security is crucial to the continuous well-being of
modern organizations. Humans play a significant role in the
processes needed to secure an organization's information
resources. Without an adequate level of user \textbf{co-operation}
and \textbf{knowledge}, many security techniques are liable to be
misused or misinterpreted by users. This may result in an adequate
security measure becoming inadequate. It is therefor necessary to
educate the organization's employees regarding information
security and also to establish a corporate sub-culture of
information security in the organization, which will ensure that
the employees have the correct attitude towards their security
responsibilities. Current information security education programs
fails to pay sufficient attention to the behavioral sciences.
There also exist a lack of knowledge regarding the principles, and
processes, that would be needed for the establishment of an
corporate sub-culture, \emph{specific} to information security.
Without both the necessary knowledge, \textbf{and} the desired
attitude amongst the employee, it will be impossible to guarantee
that the organization's information resources are secure. It would
therefor make sense to address both these dimensions to the human
factor in information security, using a single integrated,
holistic approach. This dissertation presents such an approach,
which is based on an integration of sound behavioral theories.
