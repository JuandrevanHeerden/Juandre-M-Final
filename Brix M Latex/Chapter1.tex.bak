\section{Background}
In today's business world information is a valuable commodity and
as such needs to be protected. It affects all aspects of today's
businesses, from top management right down to operational level.
In order to stay competitive in this information age,
organizations typically make large investments in terms of time,
money and energy to streamline the processes of capturing,
generating and distributing vital information resources throughout
the organization. Unfortunately, this distribution of
mission-critical information throughout the company also increases
the likelihood of misuse or damage to information resources
\cite{B:Haag:00}. Such misuse or damage could have devastating
effects on an organization's overall well being.
